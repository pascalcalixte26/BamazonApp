# BamazonApp

The purpose of this app is to show customers/users products available for purchase from our database

Once they see what is available they will then be able to place an order based on availability of a particular product from our table

If the order they place is less than what is available, the purchase will go through

If the order they place is too high, then the purchase will NOT go through

Below is screencaps and gifs of application in action
